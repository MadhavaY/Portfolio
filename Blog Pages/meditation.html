            <h3 class="blog-headings">What is meditation?</h3>
            <p class="text">
                I will put this into simple words meditation means remaining unrelated with your thought process. The
                moment
                when no thoughts go through your mind , this moment is called mediation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-headings">How meditation will help you?</h3>

            <p class="text">
                I have studied a bit of psychology in college , you may get this question "wait what is the relation
                between
                meditation and psychology?" , a neurologist - Sigmund Freud put up a theory on three states of mind. He
                divided human conscious into three levels of awareness conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.
            </p>

                Most of the time humans are in the unconscious state of mind. This unconscious mind contains feelings,
                thoughts, urges, memories and contents that are unacceptable or unpleasant, such as feelings of pain,
                anxiety, or conflict. Meditation will help you to live in the moment or in the conscious state of mind
                without all those unpleasant thoughts and feelings.
                <br><br>
                Every human has to go through some sort of struggle to see the better side of life. And every problem has a
                solution, finding the solution is hardest part of it. But when you are calm and composed you can do it
                effortlessly, you will have a balance between chaos and calmness.
            </p>

            <h3 class="blog-headings">How to start meditating?</h3>

            <p class="text">
                There is a Japanese way to meditate where you can keep a candle in front of you and try to concentrate on
                the flame. This is basic meditation you can do. You may get thoughts while concentrating on the flame, but
                try to concentrate and limit the number of thoughts. This will help you to focus on the things you do or the
                work you do.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Another way is to focus on your breath. We have to concentrate on our breath and feel the depth of our
                breathe. When you start breathing meditation you may feel that our breath is just reaching our neck or your
                lungs. But when you do it for a year or two you will feel the breath going till our abdominals. This feeling
                of breath in your abdominals will take years of practice. In this process of meditation you will see a lot
                of changes like the amount of concentration, the way you think and most importantly you will notice your
                inner body-blood flowing, air moving and more simple movements inside your body. The brighter the things you
                see while you are meditating the deeper your meditation is. It does not mean that you cannot meditate if you
                can't see anything bright, it takes time and practice reach to this state.
            </p>
                
            
            


           <h3 class="blog-headings"> The Chakra Talk‚Ä¶</h3>


            <p class="text">
                Read my blog Diving deeper into meditation if you are not familiar with Chakras.
            The Agna chakra is one of the seven chakras. It is pronounced as 'Agya chakra' or Ajna. The Agna chakra or
            the third eye chakra will start to get activated when we start breathing. Not everybody feel the same when
            the agna chakra gets activated, everyone has their own experience. It will help in supressing materialistic
            desires. Humans cannot completely kill their desires but meditation will help you supress or reduce them.
            When you meditate and activate agna chakra energy will be stored in it. As you meditate and activate agna
            chakra the energy in it will be increased as well. When this energy gets bigger and bigger it will burst, so
            you have to give a path for agna to flow the energy. But what happens when it bursts? All the things that
            agna chakra helped you like supressing desires , lust. All of them comeback. To not let this happen we have
            to activate Muladhara Chakra. But why Muladhara chakra? ‚ÄúMula‚Äù means source and ‚Äúadhara‚Äù means foundation.
            In the structure of the body this is the base. If you wish to grow you need to cultivate this.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Muladhara chakra is the first chakra among the seven chakras. It is where human life starts and we have to
            activate or awaken it. This chakra gives us the physical strength we need, it gives us control over hunger,
            sleep and it also gives us confidence and stability. Just like this we have to activate all the chakras in
            line Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddha and finally Agna. If we don't open a path for the
            energy to flow we may get sick ,or emotional imbalance can happen.
        </p>

            <p class="text">
                I suggest you not to do concentrate on the chakra's, it is better to focus on the breathing meditation. I
            never try to activate the chakras but sometimes when i concentrate on the ajna chakra i feel like ants are
            moving all over that area or like a force in that area. Few people may also get headache when they
            concentrate on ajna chakra because they are concentrating on the area of the ajna chakra with their eyes.
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            One chakra i didn't mention is the Sahasrara chakra which is placed on top of our head. When you normally
            meditate and concentrate on the ajna chakra you will feel a sensation of something on top of your head. When
            you concentrate on it you will feel like your energy is flying in the air or someone pulling your energy
            from above. But if something wrong happens with Sahasrara chakra you may get mentally disturbed. You may do
            it with the help of a guru.
          </p>
            
           <p class="text">
            And do note that when your done meditating don't open your eyes immediatley you have to open them slowly.
            First you have to come to a normal state and then move your legs and hands and then you can open your eyes
            and then wakeup from meditation.
            </p>
